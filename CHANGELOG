	  Updated the makefile for librosie (the ffi library).
	  Updated some sample files that use librosie.

	* v0.99h

	Fixed a CLI bug introduced in v0.99g in which patterns entered at the
	command line could not contain quotes.  (The bug appeared when more
	debugging information was added to 'rosie -info', which now prints the
	command line (with arguments) that invoked rosie.

	The rosie-lpeg makefile had a default setting of debug ENABLED.  This
	slows down lpeg and is only useful for development of Rosie itself.  The
	default is now to DISABLE debugging, which then enables optimization
	level -O2 for the compiler.

	The old ./run command was deprecated (and disappeared) in v0.99g.  In
	its place now is a script that announces the deprecation of that
	command.  Anyone reading an older Rosie blog or presentation may try
	./run, and they will now be guided to bin/rosie instead.

	* v0.99g

	Moved core source files into src/core
	Makefile now compiles src/core/*.lua using bin/luac as needed

	Created submodules for Lua, cjson, and lpeg
	Makefile now looks for these in the submodules directory

	Rosie is now started (launched) in a different way:
	- The ROSIE_HOME/run script has been removed
	- There is now a bin/rosie script which is generated by the Makefile
	- 'make install' links /usr/local/bin/rosie (by default) to bin/rosie
	- src/run-rosie is a script that requires a first arg which points to
	  rosie install directory (and it sets ROSIE_HOME inside rosie accordingly)

2016-10-06  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* v0.99f

	Rewrote csv.rpl to simplify it.

	Added doc/data/csv directory with sample data and sample output (JSON)

2016-10-04  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* v0.99e

	Added python sample program (uses librosie)

	Updated csv.rpl to include pipe separator, and to work better
	Added csv1.rpl for blog post on IBM developerWorks Open

	Added doc/data (sample data directory)

2016-09-13  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* v0.99d

	Added nodejs sample program (uses librosie)

2016-08-15  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* v0.99c

	Makefile now auto-detects platform (OSX or Linux, currently)

	Added travis support

	Added ffi directory with librosie and sample programs for using Rosie
	from a variety of other languages.  More samples are coming.

	Added patterns for extracting Python's block comments, as well as code
	only (no comments) to rpl/language-comments.rpl


2016-08-09  Jamie Jennings  <jjennings@us.ibm.com>

	* v0.99b

	Fixed an inadvertent change to assignment semantics that
	appeared in v0.99a wherein uses of pattern a were labeled b in the
	output because a was defined as 'a=b'.  The correct behavior is for such
	matches to be labeled a.

	Introduced this CHANGELOG.

	Moved dependencies into ROSIE_HOME/tmp directory.

	Moved docker file examples into ROSIE_HOME/docker directory.
