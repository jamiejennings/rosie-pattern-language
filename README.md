# Rosie Pattern Language (RPL)

RPL is a variant of modern Regular Expressions (regex) that is designed
to scale to big data, many developers, and large collections of patterns.  If
you use regex, you already know a lot of RPL.  Additional features over regex
found in RPL:

* Looks like a programming language, and plays well with development tools
* Comes with a library of dozens of useful patterns (timestamps, network addresses, and more)
* Has development tools: tracing, REPL, color-coded match output
* Produces JSON output (and other formats)
